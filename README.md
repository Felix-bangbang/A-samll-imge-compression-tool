# A simple tool to compress large images to specific sizes while maintaining the best quality.

It works by:

1. Using a binary search algorithm to find the optimal JPEG quality setting
2. Testing different quality values until finding one that produces a file size under your target (1MB, 2MB, or 3MB)
3. Preserving the highest possible quality while staying within size limits

Just download all the scripts and open "open.py" and put the pictures in the same folder. 
Perfect for optimizing profile pictures, avatars, and other images that have file size limits on platforms like github or social media sites :)
